An unnamed Sri Lankan maid and mother of two was sentenced to be stoned to death in August in Saudi Arabia after being found guilty of adultery. But unexpectedly, Saudi Arabian
officials have just re-opened her case. Now is our chance to get her freed.
Please sign the petition!
As of November, Saudi Arabia had put 151 people to death, for crimes that range from murder to adultery and apostasy. In this case, reports say thebaric ACTS man involved in the incident was sentenced to 100 lashes and set free, simply because he is single and the woman is married.

Stoning is just as horrible as it sounds. The woman would be bound up in public, and men would throw stones at her head until she dies a slow and painful death. This extremely harsh punishment is cruel and excessive for the crime, and we have a rare

More Maltese think their law courts are independent, Eurobarometer survey finds

The Maltese rate positively the independence of the courts, according to a Eurobarometer survey held among 445 respondents in April.

Asked to rate it in terms of independence of courts and judges, 69% of the Maltese described it as ‘very good’ or ‘fairly good’ while only 27% described it as ‘very bad’ or ‘fairly bad’.

This represented a sharp 17-point increase in positive assessments when compared to a similar survey held last year.
